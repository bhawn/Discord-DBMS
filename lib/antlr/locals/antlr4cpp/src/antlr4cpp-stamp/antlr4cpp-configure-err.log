CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:28 (CMAKE_POLICY):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    ANTLR4CPP_JAR_LOCATION
    CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
