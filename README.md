# Discord-DBMS
Please note that this is still heavily under development and that there is a lot of useless code from implementing the DBMS project into the discord bot. 

### Discord-DBMS uses the following libraries:
* [Discordpp (& its included libraries)](https://github.com/Aidoboy/discordpp)  
* [ANTLR4 (cpp target)](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4)

#### Other  
* I used Aidoboy's [aidobot](https://github.com/Aidoboy/discord-aidobot) as a base template to for main.cc. Although a lot of it has been changed from what it was.  
* The code for the DB, grammer, parser, and visitor is under lib/antlr and is a work in progress.
* Some of my codes spacing got messed up when pushing my code to github. Ill try to fix this later.
* Also note I suck at git.
